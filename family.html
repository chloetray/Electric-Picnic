    <h2>FAMILY CAMPSITE <i class="fas fa-user-friends"></i></h2>
    <p><b>FAMILY CAMPING TICKETS FOR ELECTRIC PICNIC 2019 ARE SOLD OUT</b>
<br><br>
The Family Campsite is our dedicated campsite for families with children aged 12 or under (limited to 2 children per adult). Please note that ID checks will be in place at the festival, if you feel your child looks older than 12 years old please bring ID to back this up (colour photocopies will suffice). There are showers, toilets and water points available in this campsite.
<br>
		<br>
Only people with Family Camping tickets are permitted to stay in the Family Campsite. No single or groups of adults will be permitted entry to the campsite unless accompanied by a child under aged 12 or under. It is also not acceptable to turn up to the family campsite with children aged between 13-17.  Anyone who is of this age will not gain free admission to the festival or otherwise. Anyone who arrives without a child under the age of 12 will need to camp in the general campsites. Please note that ID checks will be in place at the festival, if you feel your child looks older than 12 please bring ID to back this up (colour photocopies will suffice).
<br>
		<br>
People with Family Camping tickets have access to our dedicated Family Car Park which is located a short distance from the campsite making it easier to carry your equipment/luggage from your car.</p>

    <h2>LOST CHILDREN <i class="fas fa-child"></i></h2>
    <p>If a child is found, please notify the nearest steward immediately who will radio the Electric Picnic Control Centre. A member of the Gardai will then go to the location of the lost child. A parent who has lost a child should follow the same procedure, making contact with nearest steward who will contact the Electric Picnic Control Centre.
<br><br>
We advise that all parents write their mobile numbers on their childâ€™s wristband, which are available from the Family Campsite and Kids Area.Remember to check this each day to ensure it's still legible.<br><br> 
Always hold hands or carry your children through busy areas.
Educate your children on what to do if they get separated from you. Advise them to stay where they are and not to move or go with anyone until a Garda or Steward approaches them. They should indicate their phone number to the Garda or Steward.
Please register your children before arriving at the festival.
Children must be accompanied by Parent/Guardian at ALL times.</p>
