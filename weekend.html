	  <h1>WRISTBANDS</h1>
	  <p>The wristband tents are located just inside each campsite gate so you need to swap your ticket for a wristband before you enter the campsite and pitch your tent. 
Re-admittance to the site is only possible once you have got your wristband. Entrance to the arena is only possible with a valid wristband. There is no readmission on day tickets.
Wristbands removed from the wrist or tampered with will be rendered invalid and will not be replaced.
To avoid any disappointment we advise all ticket holders to leave plenty of time to get their wristband and allow time to walk to the arena and the stages to avoid missing any of your chosen acts.
We advise all day ticket purchasers to arrive early to avoid missing any of their chosen acts and to leave ample time to get from the day arena entrance to the stages.</p>

	  <h1>LOYALTY TICKET OFFER (SOLD OUT)</h1>
	  <p>The Loyalty Ticket Offer for Electric Picnic 2019 is now finished.

If you wish to automatically receive your loyalty code for future Electric Picnic events from Ticketmaster, please ensure youâ€™re signed up to receive marketing emails from Ticketmaster.

Please note that tickets are subject to availability. The loyalty scheme (and use of discount codes) will end at Midnight Sunday 30th September, or in the event of a sell-out of the allocation, whichever comes first. A discount code or request for a discount code does not guarantee a ticket purchase and tickets are sold on a first come first serve basis. Requests for codes are dealt with on a first come first serve basis and requests without obvious proof may take longer to research, process and return codes. We cannot guarantee to supply a discount code requested after Midnight on Monday, 24th September. The number of available discounted tickets are limited and receipt of a discount code does not guarantee a purchase of a ticket(s). Tickets may sell out before the stated deadlines. The use of discount codes will end once the loyalty tickets have sold out.</p></div>
